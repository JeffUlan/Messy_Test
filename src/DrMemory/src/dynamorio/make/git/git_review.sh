# Usage: git review (-u|-c) [-q] [-r <reviewer>] [-s <subject>]
# One of -u (upload new patchset) or -c (finalize committed review) must be
# supplied.
# Optional arguments:
#  -q = quiet, don't auto-send email
#  -r <reviewer> = specify reviewer email (else it will be queried for)
#  -s <subject> = specify patchset title (else queried, or log's first line
#                 for 1st patchset)
#  -t = prepends "TBR" to the review title
#  -b = base git ref to diff against
#
# If $HOME/.codereview_dr_token exists, its contents are passed as the
# oauth2 token to the code review site.  The file should contain the text
# string obtained from https://codereview.appspot.com/get-access-token.
# If the file does not exist, a browser window will be auto-launched
# for oauth2 authentication.

# Send email by default
